#Dictionary
#Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
#A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

#Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

#Dictionary Items
#Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.
#Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])

#When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
#Unordered means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.

#Changeable
#Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.

#Duplicates Not Allowed
#Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(thisdict)

#To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the len() function:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(len(thisdict))

#The values in dictionary items can be of any data type:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 1964,
  "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}
print(thisdict)

#From Python's perspective, dictionaries are defined as objects with the data type 'dict':<class 'dict'>
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(type(thisdict))

#It is also possible to use the dict() constructor to make a dictionary.
thisdict = dict(name = "John", age = 36, country = "Norway")
print(thisdict)

#Accessing Items
#You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict["model"]

#There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result:
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict.get("model")
print(x)

#The keys() method will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict.keys()
print(x)

#The list of the keys is a view of the dictionary, meaning that any changes done to the dictionary will be reflected in the keys list.
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.keys()
print(x) #before the change
car["color"] = "white"

#Get Values
#The values() method will return a list of all the values in the dictionary.

#Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:  
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.values()
print(x) #before the change
car["color"] = "red"

#Get Items
#The items() method will return each item in a dictionary, as tuples in a list.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict.items()
print(x)

"year": 1964
}
x = car.items()
print(x) #before the change
car["color"] = "red"

#Check if Key Exists
#To determine if a specified key is present in a dictionary use the in keyword:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
if "model" in thisdict:
  print("Yes, 'model' is one of the keys in the thisdict dictionary")

#Change Values
#You can change the value of a specific item by referring to its key name:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["year"] = 2018

#Update Dictionary
#The update() method will update the dictionary with the items from the given argument.
#The argument must be a dictionary, or an iterable object with key:value pairs.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.update({"year": 2020})

''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

#Adding Items
#Adding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index key and assigning a value to it:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["color"] = "red"
print(thisdict)

#Update Dictionary
#The update() method will update the dictionary with the items from a given argument. If the item does not exist, the item will be added.

  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.update({"color": "red"})

''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

#Removing Items
#There are several methods to remove items from a dictionary:

#The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.pop("model")
print(thisdict)

#The popitem() method removes the last inserted item (in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead):
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.popitem()
print(thisdict)

#The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name:  
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict["model"]
print(thisdict)

#The del keyword can also delete the dictionary completely:
"""
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict
print(thisdict) #this will cause an error because "thisdict" no longer exists.
"""

#The clear() method empties the dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.clear()
print(thisdict)

''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

#Loop Through a Dictionary
#You can loop through a dictionary by using a for loop.
#When looping through a dictionary, the return value are the keys of the dictionary, but there are methods to return the values as well.

#Print all key names in the dictionary, one by one:
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict:
  print(x)

#Print all values in the dictionary, one by one:
  thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict:
  print(thisdict[x])

#You can also use the values() method to return values of a dictionary:
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict.values():
  print(x)

#You can use the keys() method to return the keys of a dictionary:
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict.keys():
  print(x)

#Loop through both keys and values, by using the items() method:
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x, y in thisdict.items():
  print(x, y)      

''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

#Copy a Dictionary
#You cannot copy a dictionary simply by typing dict2 = dict1, because: dict2 will only be a reference to dict1, 
#and changes made in dict1 will automatically also be made in dict2.
#There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in Dictionary method copy().

#Make a copy of a dictionary with the copy() method:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)

#Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in function dict().
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)

''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

#Nested Dictionaries
#A dictionary can contain dictionaries, this is called nested dictionaries.
#Create a dictionary that contain three dictionaries:
myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}
print(myfamily)

#Or, if you want to add three dictionaries into a new dictionary:
#Create three dictionaries, then create one dictionary that will contain the other three dictionaries:
child1 = {
  "name" : "Emil",
  "year" : 2004
}
child2 = {
  "name" : "Tobias",
  "year" : 2007
}
child3 = {
  "name" : "Linus",
  "year" : 2011
}
myfamily = {
  "child1" : child1,
  "child2" : child2,
  "child3" : child3
}
print(myfamily)

#Access Items in Nested Dictionaries
#To access items from a nested dictionary, you use the name of the dictionaries, starting with the outer dictionary:
myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}
print(myfamily["child2"]["name"])
